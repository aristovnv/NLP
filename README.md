Procurement Categorization
Applying Natural Language Processing for Initial Categorizing of Product Descriptions

The procurement process is a critical aspect of any
companyâ€™s operations, and optimizing it can lead to significant
cost savings. This study presents a methodology for enhancing
the categorization of procurement items by mapping them to the
United Nations Standard Products and Services Code (UNSPSC).
By applying this approach, companies can analyze procurement
patterns more effectively, consolidate purchases, and negotiate
better terms with suppliers, thereby reducing overall costs.
Given the lack of substantial labeled training data often
encountered in real-world scenarios, traditional machine learning
techniques for categorization are not feasible. To overcome this
challenge, we employed Natural Language Processing (NLP)
techniques using spaCy to clean and preprocess item descriptions,
followed by embedding methods to generate vector representations for both the procurement data and UNSPSC categories.
Our approach resulted in the initial mapping and categorization of approximately 29% of the dataset, providing a solid foundation for further analysis. This initial success demonstrates the
potential for significant improvements in procurement efficiency.
Additionally, we propose several advanced techniques to enhance
the categorization process, suggesting that a higher categorization
rate is achievable.
